# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

With the addition of `composer.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`, we are close
to launching a public alpha version 0.1.0 and moving the project to
git.drupalcode.org to become a proper contrib module. :tada:
